Makefile rules:

Makefile in project folder (DPLKYL002_Lab5):

[* - use these rules here]

make - compile this project folder only
*make all - compile the entire project
*make run
*make clean - clean the entire project

Makefiles in /libs/valueiterationlib folders:
make - compile this folder only
make clean - clean this folder only

Explanation of what each file does and how it fits into the program as a whole:

ValueIteration.cpp & ValueIteration.h - These source and header files implements the ValueIteration algorithm.

Driver.cpp - This driver source file contains the main function (entry point to the program).
